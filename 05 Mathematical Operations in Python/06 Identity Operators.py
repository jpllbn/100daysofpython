# Python Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location

# is operator - Returns True if both variables are the same object

x = 3
y = x
print(y is x)

# is not operator - Returns True if both variables are not the same object
print(y is not x)
