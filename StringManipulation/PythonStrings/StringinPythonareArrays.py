# Strings in Python are Arrays
# Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
# However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
hello = "Hello World"
print(hello[4])
