# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# Legal Variable Names

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# Note: Remember that variable names are case-sensitive

# Camel Case
myVariableName = "John"
# Pascal Case
MyVariableName = "John"
# Snake Case
my_variable_name = "John"
