# Escape Character
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
#
# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
#
# An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

# The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:

txt = "We are so called \"Viking\" in the north"

print(txt)

# Other escape characters used in Python:

print("I\'m John Paul B. Labanon")
